## Finding maximum number in an array list
To find the largest element in an array, iterate over each element and compare it with the current largest element. If an element is greater, update the largest element. At the end of the iteration, the largest element will be found.

Compare arrays[i]
with arrays[i + 1]
, if arrays[i] > arrays[i + 1]
are
exchanged. So continue until the last number, arrays[length - 1]
is the
maximum.
