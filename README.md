## What's This All About? 🤔

This repository is your all in one **Python implementations** of essential data structures and algorithms. Think of it as your coding playground, where you can:
- Learn how data structures work under the hood.
- Understand algorithms step-by-step.
- Practice solving problems efficiently.
- Prepare for coding interviews or competitive programming.

Each implementation comes with clear explanations, examples, and test cases to make sure you really *get it*. So, let’s dive in! 🚀

## What' insides
### Data Structures

These are the building blocks of any program. We’ve got:

- **Linear Data Structures**:
  - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues.
  - Fancy stuff like Priority Queues and Deques.
- **Non-Linear Data Structures**:
  - Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs, AVL Trees, Heaps, Tries).
  - Graphs (Directed, Undirected, Weighted).
- **Advanced Data Structures**:
  - Hash Tables, Disjoint Sets, Bloom Filters,

### Algorithms

These are the recipes for solving problems. We’ve covered:

- **Searching**: 
- **Sorting**
- **Graph Algorithms**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Backtracking**
