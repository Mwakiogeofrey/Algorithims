## Trees
In this chapter you will learn what a tree is and the difference between trees and graphs
You get comfortable with running an algorithm over a tree
You learn depth-first search and see the difference between depth-first search and breadth-first search
You learn Huffman coding, a compression algorithm that makes use of trees

A tree is a connected acyclic graph

# Binary-trees
Computer science is full of different types of trees. Binary trees are very common type of tree.
Binary tree is a special type of tree where nodes can have at most two children(hence the name binary, meaning two), these are traditionally called left child and right child.

# Huffman coding
It is a neat example of using binary trees. it's also the foundation for text compression algorithms. We wont describe the algorithm but we will spend time focusing on how it works and how it makes clever use of trees
